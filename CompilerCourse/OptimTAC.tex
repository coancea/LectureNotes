\section{Optimizations: Bird-Eye View}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Code-Optimization Motivation and Requirements}

Compiler's target code is still \emp{not as good} as the hand-tuned code of
the assembly-language \emp{expert}, but is \emph{better} than what \emph{most
programmers} would generate, even if they wanted to.

\bigskip

Achieved via code transformations, albeit the result is hardly optimal.

\bigskip
\pause

\emp{An optimization}, a.k.a., code transformation, \emp{needs to}:


\begin{itemize}

\item \alert{preserve the observable behavior of the original prg (semantics),}\smallskip

\item speed-up the program by a measurable amount (on average),\smallskip

\item prg's size not an issue but may affect instr-cache performance,\smallskip

\item be worth the effort, e.g., compile time, maintainability, etc.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}



\begin{frame}\frametitle{High-Level Optimization Strategy}

The compiler effort for a certain code fragment is relative to:

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}

\item the number of times the prg will be run (user sets optim level);\smallskip

\item the amount of time spent in that code fragment relative to the
        progrm's runtime.\smallskip

\end{itemize}

\pause
\bigskip

Code optimization problems are NP-complete or undecidable:

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}

\item in many cases even NP-complete to aproximate, hence\smallskip

\item cannot expect to find a global optimum in a reasonable time.\smallskip

\end{itemize}

\pause
\bigskip

Strategy: spend the compiler effort in hot areas, e.g., loop nests:

\begin{itemize}

\item programers can write clear code in high-level languages\smallskip

\item while still getting efficient execution.\smallskip

\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
    \frametitle{Optimizations at Three-Address-Code (TAC) Level}

Interm-lang optimizations, e.g., \textsc{TAC}, portable to various backends:

\smallskip

\begin{itemize}

\item \textsc{TAC} is more flexible than \textsc{AbSyn} for local code transformations,\smallskip

\item \emph{we can rebuild the control-flow or global structure from \textsc{TAC}!}\smallskip

\end{itemize}

\pause
\bigskip

\emp{A basic block} is a \textsc{TAC} sequence where the flow of control 
enters at the begining and leaves at the end:

\smallskip

\begin{block}{Example of a Basic Block (straight-line code):}
\begin{colorcode}[fontsize=\scriptsize]

    t6 := t5 + c
    d  := t2 * t2
    \emp{if(d = 0) goto L4}
\end{colorcode} 
\end{block}


\bigskip

Local Optimizations: reordering \textsc{TAC} instructions in a basic block.\smallskip

at the \emp{start/end of the block}.

\subsection{Identifying Loops}


\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
    \frametitle{Identifying Loops, Preliminaries}

{\bf Motivation}: loops is where most of the time is spend!

\pause
\bigskip

{\bf Defition}: A loop, $L$, is a subgraph of the \textsc{CFG} such that:

\begin{itemize}

\item all nodes of the loop are \emp{strongly connected}, i.e., the loop
        contains a path between any two loop nodes.

\item the loop has \green{an unique entry point}, named \emph{header}, such that

\item the only way to reach a loop node is through the entry point.

\end{itemize}

A loop that contains no other loop is called an {\em inner loop}.

\pause
\bigskip

{\bf Dominator Definition}: a node $p$ \emp{dominates} node $q$ if all paths from
the start of the program to $q$ go through $p$.

\bigskip

{\bf Identifying} loops requires finding their ``\emp{back edges}'':

\begin{itemize}

\item edges in the program in which the destination node dominates
        the source node.

\item a loop must have \green{an unique header}, and \emp{one or more backedges}.

\item header dominates all blocks in the loop, otherwise not unique.

\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{block}{Algorithm for Dominators. $D(n)$ is the set of dominators of block $n$.}
%\begin{colorcode}[fontsize=\scriptsize]
{\bf Input}: \textsc{CFG} with node set $N$, initial node $n_0$.
{\bf Output}: $D(n), \forall n \in N$\\
$D(n_0) := \{ n_0 \}$\\
for $n \in N - \{n_0\}$ do $D(n)$ := $N$\\
{\tt~~}\\

{\tt~~~~~~~~}$D(n)$ := $\{n\} \cup \alert{(\cap_{p\in pred(n)} D(p))}$
%\end{colorcode} 
\end{block}

\pause
\bigskip

{\bf High-Level Algorithm}: With each \emp{backedge $n \rightarrow d$}
($d$ is the loop header), we associate a \green{natural loop} (of $n \rightarrow d$) 
consisting of node $d$ and all nodes that can reach $n$ without going through $d$.

\bigskip

{\bf Intuition}: since $d$ is the only entry to the loop, a path from any
block outside the loop must pass through $d$.

loops, and identifying the backedges is enough to find all loops.

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]
    \frametitle{Example of Optimizations}

We have already seen \emp{\bf liveness analysis \& register allocation}.

\bigskip

\emp{\bf Common-Subexpression Elimination (CSE)}: if the same expression
$e$ is computed twice, replace if possible the second occurrence of $e$
with the temporary that holds the value of the first computation of $e$.

\bigskip

\emp{\bf Copy Propagation (CP)}: after a statement {\tt x~:=~y}, 
we know that {\tt x} and {\tt y} have the same value, hence we can replace 
all occurrences of {\tt x} with {\tt y} between this assignment and the next 
definition of {\tt x} or {\tt y}.

\bigskip

\emp{\bf Dead-Code Elimination (DC)} (one reason is copy propagation):
\begin{itemize}
    \item can safely remove any statement that defines a dead variable,
    \item a branch to dead code moved to whatever follows the dead code,
    \item if a branch-condition value is statically known $\Leftrightarrow$ merge two BBs.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\emp{\bf Constant Folding and Propagation (CtF/P)}: if possible,
expressions should be computed at compile time, and the constant
result should be propagated. {\bf And these are just a few!}

\emp{We wish to find two expressions that would always yield the same
        value, and to replace the second one with the result of the first!}

\bigskip

We say that \blue{\tt b op c} is an available expression at stmt $S$ iff:\smallskip
\begin{itemize}
    \item all routes from the start of the program to $S$ must pass through
            the evaluation of \blue{\tt b op c}, and\smallskip

    \item after the \emp{\bf last} eval of \blue{\tt b op c} there are no 
            redefinitions of \blue{\tt b} or \blue{\tt c}.
\end{itemize}

\pause
\bigskip

\emph{This means that in $S$ we can replace \blue{\tt b op c} with the result 
of its previous evaluation. {\bf Looks very similar to Copy Propagation!}}

\bigskip

Intuitively, we can think again of killing and generating expressions:\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
    \item \blue{b op c} is generated by the statement where it is evaluated,\smallskip

    \item \blue{b op c} is killed by a statement that redefines \blue{\tt b} or \blue{\tt c}.
\end{itemize}

    \item Go through $B$'s stmts in sequence, and for each \blue{\tt a := b op c}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item add \blue{\tt b op c} to $gen_e[B]$\smallskip
            \item delete any expression containing \blue{\tt a} from $gen_e[B]$\smallskip

\emph{\bf Data-Flow Equations}: for each basic block $B_i$, with $i \not= 1$:\smallskip

For each basic block $B$ do:

\bigskip

\begin{description}

    \item[(1)] Find all statements $\gamma$ of shape \blue{\tt a := b op c} 
                    in $B$, such that \blue{\tt b op c} $\in in_e[B]$, and $B$ 
                    contains no earlier definitions of \blue{\tt b} or \blue{\tt c}.\bigskip

    \item[(2)] For each stmt $\gamma$ found in \emph{(1)}, allocate fresh temporary \blue{\tt t}.\bigskip

    \item[(3)] From $B$, search backwards along all possible paths all
                    previous statements \blue{\tt d := b op c}, and immediately
                    after them insert \emp{\tt t := d}.\bigskip

    \item[(4)] Replace statement $\gamma$ by \emp{\tt a := t}.

Searching backwards, the

Stage \emph{(4)} of Alg replaces
