This folder contains Futhark code:
    1. lssp.fut: YOU are supposed to implement it by filling the blanks as part of Assignment 1.
    1. mssp.fut is the map-reduce (MR) implementation of the maximal segment sum problem (MSSP)  
    3. gen-large-inp.fut is code that produces an array of random integers.

After you implement, you may test if it validates on the default dataset, provided at the 
beginning of the file by:
    $ futhark-test lssp.fut

To create a large dataset:
    $ futhark-c gen-large-inp.fut
    $ ./gen-large-inp < data/arr_size.in > data/large.in

To compile to a sequential-C version and then run on CPU:
    $ futhark-c lssp.fut
    $ ./lssp -t time1 < data/large.in

To compile to a OpenCL-C version and then run on GPGPU:
    $ futhark-opencl lssp.fut
    $ ./lssp -t time2 < data/large.in

The results will be displayed after each run.

Files time1 and time2 report runtimes in microseconds.
