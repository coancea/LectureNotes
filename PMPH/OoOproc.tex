\frametitle{Dynamic Instruction Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Static pipelines: exploit parallelism exposed by the compiler\pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item instrs are stalled in ID until they are hazard free
                \item compiler is limited in what it can do, e.g., 
                        indirect arrays, biased branches, etc.
            \end  {itemize}\medskip
 
    \item Potential for exploiting a large amount of ILP across 100s of instrs\pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item must cross basic block boundaries,
                \item data-flow execution order instead of thread order.
            \end  {itemize}\medskip

    \item Dynamic instruction scheduling separates decoding from scheduling\pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item decode instrs and dispatch them to queues, where
                \item they wait for input operands to become available,
                        then are executed.
                \item Hence no stalls in ID due to data hazards (only structural).
            \end  {itemize}\medskip

    \item Several challanges\pause
            \begin{itemize}
                \item all data hazards possible ({\sc raw}, {\sc war}, {\sc waw}),
                        on both memory and registers,
                \item speculative execution: execute beyond conditional branches,
                \item enforce precise exception model.
            \end  {itemize}\medskip
\end  {itemize}
